              <h4> <em>Avengers: Endgame</em></h4>
              <p style="font-family:Times New Roman">I'm a fan of superheroes, so I am really fascinated with the superhero movie series. In my opinion, Avengers: Endgame is one of the greatest superhero movies ever. I really enjoy the way director depicted the timeline and the whole story--Superheroes are never alone and they would try their best to save the lives of the mankind. The slogan really shows this spirit--"Whatever it takes". The director also gives every avenger a good ending, which makes this movie more epic and outstanding. The <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/23/movies/avengers-endgame-review.html"> New York Times </a> also made a great comment about this movie. Overall, this movie is a great ending for Marvel Studio in the 1st decade.</p>

              <h4><em>Forrest Gump</em></h4>
              <p style=" font-family: Times New Roman" > Forrrest Gump has won a lot of Oscars, and it is one of the top 10 movies in the movie history. I like Forrest Gump because his story and spirit inspired several generations--In the movie, he has an optimistic attitude, a strong will, and selfless. In spite of his IQ deficiency, he still makes a huge success based on his virtue. Besides, Forrest Gump is the metraphor of the "American dream" and "American spirit"--don't look upon yourself, you destiny is on your hand. In addition, everyone should enjoy the life rather than complain about it. In conclusion, you can learn a lot of Forrest Gump.The <a href="https://screenrant.com/forrest-gump-lessons-learned/"> ScreenRant</a> mentions a lot of great characterstics about Forrest Gump, which is really helpful.</p>
