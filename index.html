              <p style="color:red"> My name is Mark Chen who come from China. I'm currently a senior student major in Economics and Accounting at UW-Madison. I'll graduate shortly in the upcoming summer term and I plan to pursue my master degree in UK. For my future master degree, since I maintian strong interests in the field of financial economics, I really want to be a part of it. In addition, it also closely relates to my intended future career path. In besides of my academic life, I am the person who also have a lot of hobbies in my daily life. In my leisure time, I really enjoy watching all varieties of movies, travelling around many places, eating delicious food, and taking photos to record my life. For more information, I will introduce these hobbies more specifically in each section. </p>
