            <h2>Photography</h2>
            <p style="font-size:110%"> My mom always mentions that taking photos is a good habit since it can help us to remember what we did in the past so that we could review it as we become older. Therefore, I absorb her advice and begin to take some photos in my daily life. As time passed, taking photos has gradually become a habit for me. In this photography, I will show photos when I was <ul><li>(1)In travel</li><li>(2)Visit my U.S host parents </li><li>(3)spending time with my family</li>
</ul>

       <p style="font-family:Times New Roman"> I really like to travel when I have leisure time, and I've been to a lot of places in U.S. I took this photo in the river in Detroit when I went to watch Bucks playoffs games.

       <p style="font-family:Times New Roman">L.A is my favorite plact to go. During each summer vocation, I normally would like to go to L.A. Among all these places, Disneyland Park is my top choice. This is the photo I took when I had a ride in the Splash mountain with my friends. </p>

       <p style="font-family:Times New Roman"> I normally only have time to spend with my family during the vocation since I study abroad. However, because of the pandmemic, I have more time to stay with my family. This is th photo I took before I came back to U.S with my mom. 
       <img src="images/cs.png" alt="photo with my cousin" width="240" height="220">
       <p style="font-family:Times New Roman"> Because of the pandemic, I stayed at home in 2020, and eventually have the opportunity to celebrate my birthday with my family. This is the photo I took with my cousin when I celebrated my 21st birthday in her house.
